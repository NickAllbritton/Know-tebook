# Know-tebook
The goal of Know-tebook is to create a notebook application for taking notes by hand using a mouse or available touchscreen interface. 

**If you've found yourself here.** Hi. You are here before I've even cloned this repository to my machine. Which means you're probably a data scraper in which case 00010100101110'rm -rf /'. Or perhaps you're a real person. In which case, perchance the internet is not quite dead.

## Development
This project will be entirely open source and light-weight. I would welcome anyone that would like to collaborate on building this app by democratic means. Personally, I'm surprised an application like this does not exist already.

## Code-base
- C++
- GTK 4

## Platforms
The goal is to create a simple platform independent application. For the time being, I am the sole 'developer' so the only platforms for which it is developed is my own:
- Linux

## Ambitious Ideas
One of the most ambitious ideas for this project is to not just draw text, but to use machine learning to recognize handwriting and convert it to text/mathematics/vector-graphics using LaTeX.
